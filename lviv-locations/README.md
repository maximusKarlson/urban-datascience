# Lviv - FourSquare Data

This notebook gives an example on how to use the data found on [FourSquare](https://de.foursquare.com) to display different locations within the beautiful ukrainian city Lviv.

## First things first

The whole notebook was created on a MacBook with Anaconda installed. Furthermore it is suggested to create a separate `env` for this project. (`conda create ENV`)

The library used for the beautiful visualizations is called `folium`. For more information please check [this](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/) link.
